Usecase for an AuthenticatedUser

[AuthenticatedUser.png] Diagram for AuthenticatedUser usecase.

* Login

	Before the user can do anything in the system, it has to authenticate
	itself using the command-interface (cli, gui, etc).

* Logout

	When the user is done with its work, the command-interface should
	automatically log the user out from the system. If not, the user will be
	logged out after some idle time (configurable).
